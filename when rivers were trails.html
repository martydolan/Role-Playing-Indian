	Despite the unlikely success of <i>Never Alone</i>, the indigenous aesthetic – both in art direction and in narrative design – never really capitalized on its moment in the world of mainstream gaming. Despite crossover media attention, few commercial games of the late 2010s attempted to reckon with the same questions of Native experience, relegating the work of indigenous video game artists to non-commercial educational or experimental games. Of the many projects in the years that followed <i>Never Alone</i>, the figurehead of the indigenous games movement became Elizabeth Le Pensée, a Canadian academic with Anishinaabe ancestry. Since 2015, she’s been involved in several indigenous gaming projects made with intentions ranging from tribal education to museum installations and even to being posted to internet “art” game communities. Of these projects, the most notable is 2018’s <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i>, a 2D text-based adventure game that is a riff on the beloved educational classic Oregon Trail. 
<br><br>
And while from the standpoint of representation politics, <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i> has a lot to say about forefronting Native perspectives and challenging our culture’s embedded settler colonialism, formally the game is much less ambitious. Examining the game through the framework of radiant storytelling, of complicating the linear “literary” tradition present even in our digital media, it’s clear that the genre constraints lifted from Oregon Trail often undermine the larger ideas the game’s narrative tries to reckon with. Like <i>Never Alone</i>, the indigenous themes of <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i> are held back by developers’ failure to imagine the capacity of video game storytelling that goes beyond the linear, scripted, “literary” history.
<br><br>One reason for the game’s inability to embrace radiant models of storytelling is the form of the work it is riffing on, Oregon Trail – that of the educational “visual novel.” Like the original 1980s PC game, <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i> is a series of text-based story prompts that the player engages with in the form of picking one action from a list of several options broken up by simple gameplay-oriented sections such as hunting. While the game’s narrative is significant in the way it reframes a notable pop-culture image of indigenous conquest, structurally these sorts of choose-your-own-adventure story games are very old fashioned, a subgenre grounded more in the early period of narrative games in the 1970s and 80s than the complexity of the contemporary moment. With their branching choices and choose-your-own-adventure dialogue options, these text-based adventure games do exemplify a sort of hypertextuality as defined by media theorists like Powell and Haas, yet the scope – quasi-linear paths either progressing towards “good” or “bad” endings – is simplistic. Even when contrasted with the not-entirely-successful incorporation of mixed-media story elements into <i>Never Alone</i>, being presented with a handful of dialogue options that only allow agency within pre-determined narrative paths is hardly an ambitious design choice. This is a recurring criticism of educational games both inside the context of indigenous studies and beyond – that the simplistic game design, often grounded in long-outdated mechanics or genre constraints, makes the act of playing the game less enjoyable and, ultimately, less impactful.
<br><br>In his book-length essay “The Art of Failure,” Jasper Juul outlines a compensative model of video game appreciation – that the reason gamers enjoy even the less enjoyable aspects of gaming (such a character dying or having to replay failed levels) is connected to the Aristotelian definition of catharsis, basically that difficulty combined with immersion raises the “stakes” of a game and makes completion that much more rewarding (Juul 39). More than anything else in the literature, Juul’s ideas about compensative failure and catharsis explain why educational games – <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i> included – fall flat. The immersion of the game is undermined by the fact that players will almost all recognize that the game they’re playing is formally derivative of a different text. Whether or not players agree with or emotionally connect to the narrative as presented by the game isn’t necessarily important because formally it “reads” more like a subversive reaction to a historical text than a game that should be engaged with on its own terms. 
<br><br>So, there is a radiant textuality to <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i>, except that instead of its narrative inviting you imagine storytelling capabilities that exist beyond the context of the game, its “hyperlinks” are directed backwards in an attempt critique the history of gaming. This in itself isn’t a bad design choice, as many videogames have successfully incorporated intertextual references into their narratives and mechanics. Yet for a story-focused game like <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i>, “borrowing” the structure of an old medium can undermine the possibilities to expand its scope. Even when compared to a game like <i>Never Alone</i>, which frequently stumbles in its attempt to incorporate radiant textuality inspired by the oral tradition, the depth of When Rivers Were Trail’s narrative is undermined by its form – more focused on critiquing and correcting the mistakes of the past than embracing the capacity of video game storytelling to change how we approach media altogether.
