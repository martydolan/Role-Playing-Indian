<br>	While <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i> ends up unfulfilling as a game specifically because of the historical, educational, and formally-derivative nature of its storytelling, La Pensée’s next video game, <i>Along the River of Spacetime</i>, addressed many of those complaints, embracing its form as an experimental, immersive VR piece whose narrative, however loose, embraces the radiant storytelling capabilities of digital media. Like the previous games explored in this project, the constraints and conceits of genre heavily influence the scope of its narrative, yet this time the developers embraced the quirks of virtual reality technology and allowed the game’s form to influence its function. 
<br><br>	Ideas about immersion are nothing new in the scholarship around game design, yet the new(er) media of virtual reality that is currently in its earliest commercial stages, similar to arcade cabinets in the early 1980s, allows even closer proximity between the player and the game world. The media theorist Marie-Laure Ryan, in her book Narrative as Virtual Reality 2: Revisiting Immersion and Interactivity in Literature and Electronic Media, connects the immersive technology of VR back to familiar ideas of hypertext. And while all video game narratives depend on interactivity to some extent, Ryan points out that VR technology is exciting because of how its spatial immersion, the illusion of being in the game world without the presence of a screen, can prevent “linkages” back to the real, or non-game, world. Ryan writes that non-VR games are more exploratory than immersive, “since the user usually does not act like a character… [but rather] explores possibilities encoded in the text” (Ryan 193). These types of games, Ryan argues, are more “readerly” than most of the scholarship will admit, in which a player merely interfaces with code to follow the paths as scripted by developers. This comes in contrast with VR technology, which even in its early stages creates entire three-dimensional worlds in which the illusion of players being present is convincing enough that it impacts the narrative. While these games are still programs “written” in code, Ryan argues that the way players cognitively interface with the is completely different, expanding beyond the restrictive literary tradition that emphasizes completion into something more iterative, experimental, and radiant. The connections between Ryan’s ideas and the other indigenous hypertexts explored by scholars like Haas are clear. The worlds created in VR technologies – even when understood as merely especially-convincing illusions – are immersive, iterative, and emphasize player agency rather than the authorial-focused, scripted nature of Western-style literature. 
 
<br><br>	<i>Along the River of Spacetime</i> is similar to Le Pensée’s earlier work in that it’s also an educational piece designed for museum (in this case, planetarium) use, yet the way that it’s design moves beyond the literary tradition’s emphasis on sequential narrative and embraces the overlap between indigenous ways of knowing and the interface of VR technology. Le Pensée situates the project inside the growing field of indigenous futurism, merging 360 degree immersive video with hand-drawn 2D images of indigenous constellations “projected” onto the sky. Unlike <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i>, which relied on the storytelling conceit of subverting the canon’s depiction of indigeneity, <i>Along the River of Spacetime</i> replaces completion-emphasizing linear narrative with a focus on exploration, interaction, and obtaining indigenous knowledge as a sort of reward. The ideas are similar to that of <i>Never Alone</i> in that the gameplay “hyperlinks” to native knowledge that lacks in-game utility like a traditional power-up or collectable would be. However, unlike the way <i>Never Alone</i>’s puzzle game structure emphasized a sense of progression and completion that runs counter to its narrative, Le Pensée deliberately designed <i>Along the River of Spacetime</i> to avoid the mechanics undermining its message. In an interview with Digital Education and Culture magazine, Le Pensée explains this choice to make the project less game-like, saying that, “I didn't want a game that gave away all of the knowledge with pattern memorization and matching mechanics. Instead, I hope for them to be in that place, practicing patience and attentiveness.” It’s also significant that formally, the project resembles something in between a video game, art exhibit, and museum installation where people have to wait in line – Le Pensée describes the installation of the original project inside a stadium as also serving the thematic message, that “while people were waiting in line, they could get a sense of the stars, which helped more people be able to more fully experience the game” (“Artist Talk”).
<br><br>	Ironically, while <i>Along the River of Spacetime</i> is the least game-like of all the pieces explored in this project, its lessons about game design embracing the narrative capabilities of new media open up new possibilities for commercial games as well. While <i>Never Alone</i> and <i>When Rivers Were Trails</i> both have a lot to say about creating a uniquely indigenous space in the gaming world, the way in which they fail to imagine the narrative frontiers of video game media is a missed opportunity. Despite its emphasis on education and more limited scope, <i>Along the River of Spacetime</i> is a fascinating look into what happens when game designers are able to align their narratives with the storytelling capacity of their chosen form – even more so when the narrative in questions emphasizes indigenous modes of ancestral knowledge that push back against audience preconceptions of what video games and literature as a whole have to look like.
